# Nelly Dyulgerova - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Nelly! I have an analytical background in the aviation industry. After 5 years in the MRO industry I have developed a strong foundation in the material and demand planning and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I recently decided to upgrade my skills and completed a Data Analyst Course. I learned the latest analytics tools and techniques, how to work with SQL, Python language and Power BI. I also gained an understanding of the art of creating data visualizations, and how to apply statistics and predictive analytics in a business environment. 

I believe that the best way to showcase your experience is by showing what work you have done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:). So here is my certificate (with the date of completion in brackets): <br/>
