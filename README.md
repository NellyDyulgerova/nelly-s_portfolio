# Nelly Dyulgerova - Data Analyst Portfolio

### About 
Hi, I'm Nelly! I have an analytical background in the aviation industry. After 5 years in the MRO industry I have developed a strong foundation in the material and demand planning and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I recently decided to upgrade my skills and completed a Data Analyst Course. I learned the latest analytics tools and techniques, how to work with SQL, Python language and Power BI. I also gained an understanding of the art of creating data visualizations, and how to apply statistics and predictive analytics in a business environment.

### Portfolio Projects 

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

**Customer Satisfaction Analysis**<br/>
**Code**: [Customer Satisfaction Olist Store](https://github.com/NellyDyulgerova/Customer-Satisfaction-Olist/blob/1292423f4eba46608e8be76edfa070a606593494/Team_3_Technical_submission_1.ipynb)<br/>
**Presentation**: [Understanding Customer Satisfaction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e690U1onQjJPfMCgZEoIsn-lpthkuDvq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113246996177351945786&rtpof=true&sd=true)<br/>
**Description**: This project is based on a Brazilian eCommerce public dataset made at Olist Store. Olist is essentially an aggregating platform - it offers suppliers or sellers the possibility to sell their products at their website and connects them to potential buyers. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. This was my final team-based course assignment.<br/>
You can find more information about the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).<br/>
**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, predictive statistics, regression analysis, machine learning, data visualization.<br/>
**Technology**: SQL, Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Power BI<br/>
**Results**: Identification of the key drivers of customer satisfaction, data-based business recommendations.<br/>

### Certificates 

I believe that the best way to showcase your experience is by showing what work you have done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:). So here is my certificate (with the date of completion in brackets): <br/>
